# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

This project has been assigned on theodinproject.com. I have learned several aspects of classes, modules, and their relationship to each other. I used instance variables from the player class to instantiate my users and used the board class and visual class to create, save, change, and display the grid in real time as Users input their choices. I wish to further solidify my understanding of classes/modules and scope of variables in future projects/assignments.

For future consideration, I wish to revisit this project and add options to configure the board's dimension (4x4, 5x5, etc.) and to let the player have the option to play against a computer opponent.
